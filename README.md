# **Project Description**: Temperature Regulator for School Project
This project involves the design and implementation of a temperature regulator as part of a school assignment. The primary objective is to create a system that can accurately monitor and control the temperature within a specified environment. The project should be able to run on any computer that uses Arduino IDE.

## **Key Features**:

**Temperature Monitoring:** Utilizes LM35 sensors to continuously measure the ambient temperature of a radiometer. 

**Control Mechanism:** Integrates a microcontroller *(Arduino Mega)* to process sensor data and adjust heating or cooling circuits accordingly, through the use of PWM-signals.

**User Interface:** Includes a user-friendly interface for setting desired temperature ranges and monitoring real-time data. For this i use a Arduino LCD-touchscreen.

**Energy Efficiency:** Optimized to maintain temperature with minimal energy consumption. This is made possible through a custom made algorithm.

This project aims to provide a practical solution for maintaining consistent temperatures, demonstrating fundamental principles of electronics, programming, and system integration.
